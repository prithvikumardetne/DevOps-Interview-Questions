12.What is bandwidth?
answer:- Bandwidth is the amount of data that can travel over a network at once, similar to how wide a highway is for cars

Observation 1:
The people who got $200k-$500k+ offers talked extensively about 3 topics: 

- mentors they learned from
- metrics they measure (and why)
- how they drive revenue for the business 

Observation 2: 
The people who got these offers only talked ~50% of the time.

They asked intentional questions about the 
- hiring manager
- company
- culture
- team
- goals

Observation 3: 
The people who did NOT get offers 
- didn't ask questions throughout the call
- didn't talk about business outcomes
- didn't talk about metrics 
- didn't give credit to mentors/team
- tried to look completely perfect


If I were interviewing right now, I would
- list the metrics I measure (and why)
- know how I drive revenue for the business 
- research the company/interviewers
- ask Qs that can't be answered by Google
- know the value I bring to the company 
- make a list of my mentors + send them a note of gratitude for teaching me XYZ

Explain how kubernetes networking works, save this post and share with your community

Pod Networking:

Pod: A group of containers that share the same network namespace.
Pod IP: Each pod is assigned a unique IP address within the cluster.
CNI (Container Network Interface): A plugin that manages pod networking. It creates network interfaces, assigns IP addresses, and configures routes.

Cluster Networking:

Network Plugin: A component responsible for providing network connectivity between pods and external services.
Overlay Networks: These networks create a virtual network on top of the physical network.
Routing: The network plugin handles routing between pods in different nodes.
Service Discovery: Kubernetes provides a mechanism to discover services within the cluster. This allows pods to communicate with each other without knowing their exact IP addresses.

Service Mesh:

A layer of abstraction: A service mesh provides a layer of abstraction for service-to-service communication.
Traffic Management: It handles tasks like load balancing, fault tolerance, and security.
Sidecar Proxy: Each pod typically has a sidecar proxy that handles network traffic.

Key Concepts and Components:

CNI (Container Network Interface): A plugin that manages pod networking.
Network Plugin: A component responsible for providing network connectivity between pods and external services.
Overlay Networks: These networks create a virtual network on top of the physical network.
Service Discovery: Kubernetes provides a mechanism to discover services within the cluster.
Service Mesh: A layer of abstraction for service-to-service communication.
Sidecar Proxy: A proxy that handles network traffic for a pod.

Common Networking Approaches:

Overlay Networks: VXLAN, Calico, Flannel, Weave Net, and Cilium are common overlay network solutions.
Host-Port Networking: Pods can be directly exposed to the host network.
IP-Per-Pod: Each pod gets its own IP address.
Additional Considerations:
Network Policies: Kubernetes allows you to define network policies to control traffic flow between pods.
Ingress Controllers: Ingress controllers handle incoming traffic to the cluster.
Load Balancing: Kubernetes provides built-in load balancing capabilities.

18 -  Key Release Management Metrics

1. Percent of release success rate
This metric simply shows the percentage of planned releases that are deployed on time. There are many factors that can prevent releases from happening on schedule, some of which are difficult to avoid (such as changing priorities). For example, the 2020 State of Code Review survey cites changing requirements as the single biggest reason for missing release deadlines. Another common cause of delays is miscommunication when handing off work between departments, which can be improved by streamlining release processes and strengthening collaboration via culture and tools.

When pinpointing bottlenecks in your release process, it’s helpful to have a quick, all-inclusive view of where you are spending your time. Plutora’s dashboard below breaks down releases into phases and types, providing a granular view of the average phase and gate duration, bringing to light where constraints are in the release process.  


2. Percentage of Escaped Defects
This measures the defects that make it past production and are found by customers post-release. Naturally it’s impossible (and perhaps even undesirable) to catch all bugs, as that would involve laboriously checking and rechecking features at the cost of velocity. For example, NASA was able to achieve zero defects for its Space Shuttle Software, but at great expense -- thousands of dollars per line of code. Most projects won’t require that level of scrutiny; however,  it’s still an important measure that directly impacts customer satisfaction and maintenance costs. Ultimately, it’s up to the business to find that “sweet spot” of balancing quality and speed to best serve customers.  

Percentage of escaped defects is generally used as one of the key indicators of QA performance, but keep in mind that all bugs are not equal -- some are mission critical, while others are merely cosmetic. Since this metric does not weigh for importance, it’s helpful to discuss with your QA team for context.

3. Defect Density
The number of known defects per module or X lines of code. Defect density is a useful indicator of quality, and 1 defect per 1000 lines of code is typically seen as the standard for “good” quality. 

As always, keep context in mind. If your development team is putting forth substantial effort into optimizing code, defect density could increase even while the organization is improving behind the scenes. 

4. Number of Releases
The number of releases over a given timespan. It gives you insight into whether your release frequency is increasing, inconsistent or decreasing. Similar to the other metrics, context is helpful here. Perhaps in August there were several major releases, as opposed to minor ones in September. That’s why this data is best broken down by type or portfolio for additional detail. 

Refer to this sample dashboard from Plutora, which gives a quick and simple view of the types releases over time:


5. Deployment Duration
Usually measured in hours, this is the time it takes to execute a deployment. Deployment duration is useful for understanding whether deployments are causing delays. Many businesses are turning now to automation, which takes the load off of developers, reduces manual errors, and aids in pushing small changes to production. 

6. Release Duration
Usually measured in days, this is the time it takes to execute a release. This number measures how quickly a business can serve its customers, and can be useful for roadmap planning. Like other release metrics, this metric can be broken down into type to provide better context.

For instance, have a look at Plutora's release duration dashboard: 

release duration over time
7. Number of Release Backouts
Also known as a rollback, this counts the number of releases that fail to meet expectations and have to be reversed. If a workaround exists, a Request for Change (RFC) should be created to deploy the fix into production. Tracking the number of release backouts indicates the quality and thoroughness of development and testing.  

8. Proportion of Automatic Release Distribution
Usually a percentage, this metric refers to the proportion of new releases that are distributed automatically. A high number here indicates that your ITSM environment is operating effectively.

9. Downtime
Usually measured in minutes, downtime refers to the cumulative amount of time that users cannot access your software. Downtime is not always avoidable, but should be minimized as much as possible.

10. Number of Outages Caused by a Release
The number of outages, or interruptions to your service, that are directly caused by a release. Depending on the length of the outages, these can be very serious -- virtually incapacitating businesses, causing financial loss, and eroding customer trust. This metric helps business stakeholders to get a clear picture of the costs associated with any given release.

11. Number of Incidents Caused by a Release
The amount of incidents caused by a release. Incidents are also referred to as defects or bugs, and can be characterized as unexpected deviations in system behavior. This number is often used as a key metric in evaluating release team performance. 

Take a look at Plutora’s breakdown of releases by risk level to understand the risk profile of your releases. This can then be correlated with incidents in production.

releases by risk level
12. Percentage of All Changes Causing Major Incidents
Similar to the number of incidents caused by a release, this measures whether the change management team is doing their job effectively. 

In the dashboard below, you can see the breakdown of different types of changes over time. Simply overlay incident data over this chart to get a quick sense of where and when incidents are occurring.

changes over time dashboard
13. On-time Delivery
This measures the timeliness of delivery. When deadlines are consistently missed, it doesn’t necessarily mean that your team is doing a bad job -- perhaps the problem is a dearth of resources, or the scope of the project needs to be cut. 

14. Releases Delivered on Schedule by Application
Provides a breakdown of timely and successful releases by application. If an application is consistently behind schedule, that impacts the business when it comes to market share, security, and compliance concerns. 

For example, this dashboard shows the various releases by portfolio:

releases by portfolio
15. Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)
MTTR represents the average time required to repair a failed component or device. It calculates the time from the very beginning of an incident until the moment it’s solved, and provides a strong indication of how fast your organization responds to problems. 

To get this number, find out the total time spent on unplanned maintenance for a specific asset and divide that number by the number of failures that happened with that asset over a period of time. In general, a MTTR value of five hours or less is considered to be quite good.  

16. Average Lead Time
Also referred to as Time to Value, this measures the period of time between accepting a work item and pushing it to production. It tells you how long it takes for you to deliver on customers requests. When examining lead time, it’s important to know exactly what you’re measuring. You probably don’t want to include low priority tickets in this metric because it will lead to unreasonably high numbers; keep it limited to high and medium priority tickets. 

Average lead time is an essential metric for ensuring business continuity and planning, as it enables the PMs and C-suite to plan accordingly.

lead time dashboard
17. Average Cycle Time
Cycle time is how long it takes your team to deliver something after starting work on it. It provides a lot of insight to engineering leaders as to how their team is allocating its time. For instance, if features are sitting for days waiting for QA after developers are done coding, that’s a useful observation that can generate real change. A good dashboard here is invaluable, as it can help you to drill down deeper and see the exact distribution of how time is spent. 

cycle time dashboard
18. Average Cost Per Release
Calculate man-hours and salary per release to arrive at this number. This will give you an idea of the ROI of each release, resulting in better business decisions.

Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Constraints: Try to Solve this without inbuilt functions

Question 9:
Problem: Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

Input: S = "racecar"
Output: True
Constraints: Ignore case sensitivity and spaces for this problem.



1️⃣ Ping Test: 
Start with the `ping` command to check connectivity to a website or IP address. It helps determine whether your device can communicate with the server.

hashtag#Command
ping google.com

- Success: You're connected to the network.
- Failure: There may be a network issue or the destination is unreachable.

2️⃣ DNS Lookup:
If you can ping an IP but not a domain, there may be a DNS issue. Use `nslookup` or `dig` to test if DNS is resolving correctly.

hashtag#Command
nslookup example.com

This will show the IP address your DNS server resolves for the domain.

3️⃣ Check Network Configuration:
Check your network configuration using `ifconfig` (Linux/macOS) or `ipconfig` (Windows) to make sure your device has a proper IP address, gateway, and DNS settings.

hashtag#Command
ipconfig 

4️⃣ Telnet to Check Open Ports: 
If you're trying to access a service but it's not responding, use `telnet` to check if a specific port is open and accessible.

hashtag#Command
telnet example.com 80

If the connection fails, the service might be down or blocked by a firewall.

5️⃣Netstat for Active Connections:
Run netstat to view active network connections and see which ports are being used by applications. This is useful for checking open ports and connections on your device.

hashtag#Command
netstat -an

It will display all active network connections, which can help identify potential issues.

6️⃣ Traceroute:
Use traceroute to map the path data packets take to reach a destination, which helps diagnose where delays or blockages occur in the network.

hashtag#Command
traceroute google.com
